A simple tool to execute videogames or open a link to watch movies. To be able to view the list of videogames follow these steps:
 - Create a folder on your desktop and name it 'videogames'
 - Move your videogames' folders inside the folder
 - Restart the application
## How it works
To watch a movie simply type its title. When the search bar is empty, you can choose the videogame to play by pressing the up and down keys of your keyboard. To play the game/movie, hit the enter key and wait. If nothing happens, it means the movie wasn't found or the game is still loading.
